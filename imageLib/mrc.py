"""Provide methods for reading and writing files in the MRC
format.

Requires NumPy.  This module has been imported successfully
when used with the following combinations of Python and
NumPy:
    Python 2.5.6 ; NumPy 1.3.0.dev6083
    Python 2.6.6 ; NumPy 1.4.1
    Python 2.7.9 ; NumPy 1.8.2
    Python 2.7.10 ; NumPy 1.8.0rc1
    Python 3.4.2 ; NumPy 1.8.2
.  Other combinations for Python versions greater than or
equal to 2.5 and NumPy versions greater than or equal to
1.3.0 likely work.

Implements the MRC file format as described at
http://msg.ucsf.edu/IVE/IVE4_HTML/IM_ref2.html .

The Mrc class is likely easiest to use if you want read-only
access to an Mrc file or want read-write access and the
modifications that you'll make do not affect the size or
format of the extended header or image data.  The Mrc class
does use memory mapping of the file.  Depending on the
system, that may make it unusable for large files.

An example of how to use the Mrc class is this:

import numpy
import Mrc
a = Mrc.bindFile('somefile.mrc')
# a is a NumPy array with the image data memory mapped from
# somefile.mrc.  You can use it directly with any function
# that will take a NumPy array.
hist = numpy.histogram(a, bins=200)
# Print out key information from the header.
a.Mrc.info()
# Use a.Mrc.hdr to access the MRC header fields.
wavelength0_nm = a.Mrc.hdr.wave[0]

If you only want a copy of all the highest resolution data
set from a MRC file as a NumPy array, you can use load():

import numpy
import Mrc
a = Mrc.load('somefile.mrc')

The Mrc2 class is what you would use if you wanted to create
a MRC file from scratch.  An example of that is:

import numpy
import Mrc
a = numpy.reshape(numpy.asarray(
                  numpy.linspace(0, 5999, 6000), dtype='i2'),
                  (10,20,30))
m = Mrc.Mrc2('newfile.mrc', mode='w')
# If you want the header to use the MRC 2014 format rather than
# the Priism format, insert
# m.hdr = Mrc.hdrChangeToMrc2014Format(m.hdr)
# Set the header size and pixel type fields.  You could also use
# m.initHdrForArr(a) instead.
m.setHdrForShapeType(a.shape, a.dtype)
# Set other fields in the header.
m.hdr.setSpacing(0.1, 0.1, 0.3)
m.hdr.wave[0] = 540
m.hdr.mmm1 = (0.0, 5999.0, 2999.5)
m.hdr.setTitle('Written by Mrc2 of Mrc.py')
m.writeHeader()
m.writeStack(a)
m.close()

A short cut for writing a NumPy array as an Mrc file is to use
save().  If the only fields that you want to set in the header
are the basic size and pixel type information, it is very simple
to use:

import numpy
import Mrc
a = numpy.reshape(numpy.asarray(
                  numpy.linspace(0, 5999, 6000), dtype='i2'),
                  (10,20,30))
Mrc.save(a, 'newfile.mrc', ifExists='overwrite')

Known limitations:
1) Does not support the 4-bit unsigned integer sample format (mode 101).
2) Does not provide any mechanism for accessing the lower resolution
versions of the image data allowed by Priism's version of the MRC format.
3) Uses a NumPy structured array type to represent mode 3 (complex values
represented by two signed 16-bit integers) image data.  Nothing is provided
to make that data act more like standard complex arrays in NumPy.

Release notes:
Version 0.1.0 as included with Priism made the following changes which
could affect compatibility with client code:
1) Added FROM_PRIISM to the module to distinguish this version from other
versions of Mrc.py derived from Priithon.
2) Added HdrBase, HdrPriism, Hdr2014, Hdr2014Priism, ManagedTitleArray, and
ReorderedArray classes.  The combination of HdrBase and HdrPriism replaced
a class defined within implement_hdr().  They do not have the type data
attribute (2 byte field immediately after mmm1) that class had and change
the interpretation of nspg (absorbing what had been in the type data
attribute) and blank (split by adding ntst).  The title attribute changed
from being backed by a a 10a80 element in the structured array to a
(10,80)i1 element.  Since interactions with the title attribute are mediated
through a ManagedTitleArray, assigning strings to the titles should work
as before.
3) Mode 0 image data is interpreted as signed 8-bit integers for
compatibility with the MRC 2014 standard.
4) Mode 3 image data (complex values stored as two signed 16-bit integers)
was treated as one 4-byte floating-point value.  Now it's represented by a
NumPy structured array with two 16-bit signed integer fields.  The first
field is called 'real' and the second is called 'imag'.
5) The extInts and extFloats data attributes of the Mrc and Mrc2 classes are
now always set.  They may be None, depending on the size and format of the
extended header.
6) Removed insertExtHdr() from the Mrc class.
7) Removed extHdrSize, extHdrnint, and extHdrnfloat keywords from __init__()
for the Mrc class.
8) Changed the initial values in the header when an instance of Mrc2 is
created for a new file.
9) Changed the return value of MrcMode2dtype() from the generic Python type
equivalent to the sample representation to a NumPy dtype.
10) As a result of the changes for (2), changed the type returned by
implement_hdr() and makeHdrArray().
11) Changed initHdrArrayFrom() to have a return value.

    If x is a Mrc instance, x.data has the highest resolution image
    data from the file, x.hdr has the header fields, and x.e has the
    extended header as an array of unsigned 8-bit integers.  If the
    extended header size is greater than zero, the extended header
    format is Priism's format, and the number of integers or
    floating-point values per section in the extended header is
    greater than zero, x.extInts has the integer values from
    the extended header, x.extFloats has the floating-point values

    extended header has symmetry information, x.extInts is None,
    x.extFloats is None, and x.extSym is an array of 80 character
    records for the symmetry information.  Any other cases will
    have x.extInts equal to None, x.extFloats equal to None, and
    x.extSym equal to None.

    If used to modify a file, the Mrc class does not provide
    public methods to change the format or size of the image data
    or change the size of the extended header data and then remap
    the image data and extended header data into memory.  Because of
    that, it is best to use the Mrc class for read-only access or
    for read-write access where the modifications do not change
    the layout or format of the MRC file.  The Mrc2 class can
    handle more general modifications to an existing MRC file.

    Depending on the system and the handling of memory mapping
    in Python, it may not be possible to memory map files which
    are too large (around 1 gigabyte was a frequent barrier with
    Python 2.5 and earlier).  The Mrc2 class which does not use
    memory mapping could be useful for those files.

    If the size of the extended header is not a multiple of the
    size of the data type used to represent one image sample,
    the memory mapped image data will be misaligned.  Use the
    Mrc2 class for files like that.

    Version 0.1.0 of Mrc.py as included with Priism removed the
    insertExtHdr() function from this class.  It also changed the
    conditions for when the extInts and extFloats attributes are
    set.

    floating-point fields in the extended header.  When not None,
    extFloats must be a NumPy array.  The size of the last dimension
